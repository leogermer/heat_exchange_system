Simulation of a heat exchanger in a photovoltaic/pool system
======================

This is an implementation of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method
to solve systems of ODEs for a specific case:

A system of heat exchange, envolving three components: pool, heat exchanger, photovoltaic plate.

The idea is that the heat exchanger is glued under the solar plate and heats up the inside flowing water.
That water will heat up a pool and will recirculate back to the heat exchanger.

This software works extracting data from a csv file to predict temperature behaviour of
the pool and the heat exchanger plotted against time.

Notes:
-The temperature of the photovoltaic plate is set to 35ÂºC throughout the simulation.
-The file containing the data of your paramethers must be in csv format.

========================

To run this program you should have Python 3+ installed as shown in the link below:
(`https://realpython.com/installing-python/#step-1-download-the-python-3-installer`)

with the following modules:
-matoplotlib -> `pip install matplotlib`



Feel free to use and adapt to your case.
